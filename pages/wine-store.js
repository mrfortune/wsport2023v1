              A group of entrepreneurs are planning to open a new wine store in
              the Prospect-Lefferts Gardens area to serve an up and coming strip
              that does not currently have any wine stores. As they build out
              the store they have also engaged WorldShaker Interactive to design
              and build a custom e-commerce solution to serve their customers
              and future website users. They offer a very curated wine
              experience to their clients and want to mirror that experience in
              the user experience on the website.

              I recruited a group of women through my social-media network who
              I know to be wine enthusiasts. I got 9 replies to my posts and
              seleted 5 people to join me for interviews. My respondents
              consisted of 5 African American women, ages 35-45, who live in or
              near the area where the store is being built.

              those categories.
